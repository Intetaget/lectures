* Flesh out the Hangman program we started in class.
  Complete any TODOs to add:
    * A greeting for the user.
    * A prompt that tells the user the partially completed word.
    * A game over state that tells the player if they won or lost
      and tells them the word they were trying to guess.
    * **BONUS**: Prompt the player to play another game and continue until they quit.
    * **BONUS**: Input validation! Make sure the player is reprompted if they don't give a letter.
